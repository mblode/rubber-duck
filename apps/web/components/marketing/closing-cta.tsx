 * The last thing on the page, and the same action as the first thing.
 *
 * One button, the same words as the hero. A reader who has got this far has read
 * the comparison and the FAQ; offering them a second, different next step here
 * is asking them to make the decision again.
 *
 * The `<time>` is the visible half of a freshness signal whose other half is
 * `WebPage.dateModified`. Both read `PAGE_UPDATED` from `lib/content.ts`, as does
 * `app/sitemap.ts`, so the date a reader sees and the date a crawler is told
 * cannot drift apart.
