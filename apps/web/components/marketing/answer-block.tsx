/**
 * The liftable answer, directly under the fold.
 *
 * An answer engine asked "what is Rubber Duck" will quote one paragraph or
 * none. This is that paragraph, and it is written to survive being lifted with
 * nothing around it: no pronoun referring to the h1, no "the app", no dependency
 * on the sentence before it.
 *
 * The `h2` is the literal question. That is the split this page makes — the h1
 * is a claim a person wants to read, the h2 is the query a machine matched, and
 * the paragraph answers it once for both of them. Making the h1 itself the
 * question would have served the machine and cost the reader.
 *
 * Deliberately not wrapped in `Reveal`: it sits in the first viewport on a tall
 * desktop window, and content that fades in is content that is briefly absent.
