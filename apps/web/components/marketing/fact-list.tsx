 * What is not here matters more than what is. No star count, no download total,
 * no testimonials, no logo wall. This project has two GitHub stars; a page that
 * renders "2" beside a download button has spent real credibility to say
 * nothing, and diffhub deleted its own star count for exactly that reason — a
 * release count is a signal about a project, not an answer about a product.
 *
 * So every row is a fact with a link, and the closing line says out loud that
 * there is no customer roster yet. A reader who checks two of these and finds
 * them true will believe the third. A reader who finds a padded number will not
 * check anything else on the page.
