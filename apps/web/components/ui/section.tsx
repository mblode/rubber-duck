 * This briefly took a `size` prop so text sections could be narrower than the
 * ones holding a product frame. That was wrong, and wrong in a way that only
 * shows up in a screenshot: `mx-auto` centres whatever width it is given, so a
 * narrower container is not a narrower column — it is a column with a
 * different left edge. The page rendered with "What is Commandment?" starting
 * 156px to the right of "How does Commandment work?", and every prose section
 * stepping in and out down the page.
 *
 * The measure still matters; it just does not belong here. It goes on the
 * element that holds the text (`max-w-[65ch]` on a paragraph, `[40ch]` on a
 * heading), which caps the line length without moving where the line starts.
 * That is the same rule the original single-screen page recorded in a comment
 * about padding and measure, learned the same way.
