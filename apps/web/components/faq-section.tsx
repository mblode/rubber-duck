/**
 * The FAQ, as plain headings and paragraphs.
 *
 * This replaced a native `<details>` accordion, and the reasoning is worth
 * keeping because the obvious reading of it is wrong. `<details>` was never a
 * crawler bug — the copy stays in the DOM whether it is open or shut, which is
 * exactly why it was chosen over Blode UI's Accordion, whose panel content does
 * not survive server rendering at all. The problem with `<details>` here is
 * narrower and still real:
 *
 * - a `<summary>` is not a heading, so seven questions produced no document
 *   outline and a screen-reader user could not jump between them;
 * - a collapsed answer is not *rendered text*, and an answer engine asked to
 *   quote a page has to decide whether it is looking at content or at markup
 *   with something hidden in it. `acceptedAnswer.text` matching something the
 *   reader must click to see is the shape Google calls a mismatch;
 * - the page it was protecting no longer exists. Collapsing existed to keep this
 *   one screen tall. It is now ten sections, so the constraint that justified
 *   the trade is gone.
 *
 * The `id` moves onto the `<h3>` and must stay there: `faqSchema()` publishes it
 * as `acceptedAnswer.url`, so deleting it points the graph at an anchor that
 * resolves to nothing.
 *
 * `h3`, not `h2`, because the section now has a heading of its own above it.
