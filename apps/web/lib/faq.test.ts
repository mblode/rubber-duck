/**
 * The FAQ and the FAQPage node must say the same thing.
 *
 * The failure this prevents: someone improves an answer in `lib/faq.ts` and the
 * rendered copy moves while `acceptedAnswer.text` does not, or an answer is
 * rendered behind something a crawler never opens. Google calls markup that
 * asserts an answer the reader cannot see a mismatch, and the penalty is that
 * the whole node stops being trusted — including the entries that were fine.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical for this page. It shipped for months as a native
 * `<details>` accordion whose questions were `<summary>` elements rather than
 * headings, and the component it replaced carried a docblock recording that
 * Blode UI's Accordion had already been rejected because its panel content does
 * not survive server rendering at all. This test is the mechanism that would
 * have caught either without anyone reading the HTML.
