/**
 * Roman and italic are declared separately so only the roman is preloaded.
 *
 * `next/font` emits a `<link rel="preload">` for every face in a call, and
 * `preload` is a per-call option, not per-face. Declared together, the italic
 * was 103KB fetched at the highest priority to render zero glyphs — this page
 * contains no emphasis at all — while competing for the same connection as the
 * roman, which *is* the LCP font. Every LCP element on this fleet is text, so
 * that contention is not theoretical.
 *
 * Deleting the italic outright would have been simpler and is the wrong trade:
 * the browser then synthesises an oblique the first time anyone writes `<em>`,
 * and faked italic is exactly the kind of defect the house type rules exist to
 * stop. So it stays, real and drawn, one priority tier down — see the `em, i`
 * rule in globals.css that binds it.
